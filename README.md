Course work for Mobile Architect and Design

FitFollow is the name of the app that I have spent the most time working on over the span of this course. The zip file containing all of the app's contents is named "FitFollow3". My launch plan doc is also included in the zip file.

The other apps and docs were side projects that were created along with the textbook provided for the course, which helped aid in the development of FitFollow.

For the final project of this course, my fellow peers and I were given three different types of apps to choose from, and we had to pick which one we wanted to develop. I chose to develop a weight tracking app. The requirements of the app included:

A database with at least three tables: one to store the daily weight, one to store user logins/passwords, and one to store the user's goal weight.
A screen for logging into the app.
A screen to display all of the weights and the days they were entered.
A mechanism by which the user can add a daily weight.
A mechanism by which the user can add a goal weight.
A mechanism by which the app will notify the user when they reach their goal weight.
The login and display screens that I created were all necessary to support user needs. I developed two screens for the login/registration activities. The launching activity of the app is the registration screen because if a user does not have an account, they will need to register first. I provided directions on the screen to inform the user about what action they should take if they do or do not have an account. Both screens have a simple layout, making them easy to read and navigate. The main screen that displays all of the data and functions is also very simple and follows the same color scheme and design themes as the other screens. I think that my approach of making the design simplistic was a good choice for this app. I view the purpose of the app as task-oriented because it is a tool to help accomplish real-life situations. I believe the focus of the development should be the app's functionality. Overloading the design with colors/images/etc. may be unnecessary and ineffective for optimizing user interaction.

My first step in development is to thoroughly study the user requirements and ensure that I truly understand the tasks at hand. I know that I have understood the requirements when I can list the most important ones out loud without looking at a reference (although I keep prompts or requirements at hand throughout development). My next step is to conduct extensive research. The project in this course was significant, so I realized the importance of planning a project design with some form of documentation to map files, their components, and how they are integrated.

Developing the app is the most tedious part, in my opinion. My process involves examining a requirement, developing code to meet that requirement, and repeating this process until all requirements are met. I try to be practical and logical when determining what should be developed first to make development easier. Understanding the logic of application design and then actually coding are two different challenges for me. Due to my unfamiliarity with syntax, I spend a lot of time researching code and debugging. One practice that helps me with writing code is reciting what I am going to write out loud before I start.

It's hard to say what I feel was the most successful aspect of my app because I benchmark against the quality of other apps I use daily. The features and functions of my app are not exactly as I intended them to be, but for my first fully semi-developed app, I think that I did alright. I wish that I had done a better job with my add, update, and goal notification functions.
