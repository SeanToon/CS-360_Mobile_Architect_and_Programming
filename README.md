# CS-360_Mobile_Architect_and_Programming

Throughout this course, FitFollow has been the app I’ve dedicated the most time to. All of the app’s contents are stored in a zip file named "FitFollow3", which also includes my launch plan document.

In addition to FitFollow, I worked on several side projects that were created alongside the textbook provided for the course. These side projects helped supplement the development of FitFollow and provided valuable insights into mobile app design.

For the final project, my peers and I were given three types of apps to choose from. We were required to select one to develop. I chose to create a weight tracking app. The app’s requirements included the following:

A database with at least three tables: one for storing daily weight entries, one for storing user logins and passwords, and one for storing users’ goal weights.
A screen for logging into the app.
A screen to display all weight entries, along with the days they were recorded.
A mechanism to allow users to input their daily weight.
A mechanism to allow users to set and track their goal weight.
A notification feature to alert users when they reach their goal weight.
I designed the login and display screens to cater to the core needs of users. I developed two screens for the login/registration process. The registration screen serves as the launching activity because new users must create an account before using the app. I ensured the screen includes clear instructions so users can easily navigate whether they are registering or logging in. Both screens have a clean, simple layout, making them easy to read and navigate. Similarly, the main screen—where users can see their data and interact with the app—is also minimalistic and follows the same design theme. I opted for a simple design because I felt it aligned well with the app’s purpose as a tool. I believe that when developing apps for real-life tasks, it is crucial to prioritize functionality over unnecessary embellishments like excessive colors or images. Simplicity helps optimize user interaction and reduces distractions.

My development process begins with thoroughly understanding the user requirements. I know I’ve understood the requirements when I can verbally list the key tasks involved without referencing them. However, I always keep a prompt or requirement list on hand during development for easy reference. The next phase is extensive research. Since this course project was significant, I recognized the importance of planning the app’s design. This involved creating documentation to map out the files, their components, and how they are integrated with one another.

In my experience, development is the most time-consuming part. My process generally involves analyzing each requirement, writing the necessary code to meet that requirement, and repeating this until all the project requirements are fulfilled. I try to approach the development logically, determining which components to develop first in order to make the process as efficient as possible. Understanding the design logic is one thing, but translating that logic into functional code is often a different challenge. Due to my limited familiarity with certain programming languages and syntax, I spent considerable time researching code and debugging. One strategy that has been helpful for me is verbally reciting the code I’m about to write before actually typing it out. This helps clarify my thoughts and ensures I approach the code logically.

As for the success of my app, it’s hard to say definitively what I consider the most successful aspect. I tend to benchmark my app against others I use daily, which sometimes leads to disappointment in my own work. While the features and functionality of my app aren’t exactly what I envisioned at the start, I still believe I’ve made significant progress. Given that this is my first fully developed app, I’m proud of what I’ve achieved so far.

However, I do recognize that there are areas I could improve. Specifically, I wish I had done a better job with the add, update, and goal notification functions. These features didn’t work as seamlessly as I had intended, but I see them as learning opportunities for future projects.

Overall, this course has provided me with valuable experience in developing mobile apps, from conceptualization to deployment. Through FitFollow, I gained hands-on experience with user interface design, database management, and the development of functional features. While there is still room for improvement, I’m confident that the skills I’ve developed will serve me well in future projects.
